Explainable AI (XAI) is a rapidly growing aspect of the ML field that specifically focuses on increasing the transparency and interpretability of otherwise "black-box" modelling approaches. When done effectively, XAI improves trust in model predictions, assists in understanding causality within complex architectures, enhances our ability to diagnose and refine models, and improves transferability/robustness of models when moving to new domains. While there are numerous existing resources for XAI, many of these focus on relatively simple architectures and/or low dimensional data.

The spatiotemporally aware process-guided deep learning models used within the PUMP temperature project present an XAI challenge. This repository is an exploratory space to develop XAI methods for sequence to sequence models with complex architectures.
